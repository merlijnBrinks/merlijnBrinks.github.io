<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Slime Rancher is a tale of Beatrix LeBeau , a plucky young rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the 'Far, Far Range' where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes. With a can-do attitude, plenty of grit, and her trusty vacpack, Beatrix attempts to claim, amass a fortune, and avoid the continual peril that looms from rolling, jiggling avalanche of slimes around every corner!</p>


<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>The game is played in an open world and from a first-person perspective. The player controls a character named Beatrix LeBeau, a rancher who moves to a planet far from Earth to live the life of a "slime rancher", which consists of constructing her ranch and exploring the environment, in order to collect, raise, feed and breed slimes, gelatinous living organisms of various sizes and characteristics. <br /><br />

The game's main economical aspect revolves around feeding slimes the appropriate food items so that they produce "plorts", which can then be sold in exchange for Newbucks, the currency required to purchase upgrades to the rancher's equipment or farm buildings. The player moves the character around a variety of environments, and can collect slimes, food items and plorts by sucking them up with their vacuum tool (called a "VacPack", a portmanteau of vacuum and backpack). They can only store a limited number of items and item types at a time and must go back to their ranch to unload their collected items before being able to collect more. The player must buy and upgrade various enclosures to house their collected slimes. <br /><br />

Different types of slimes can be combined by feeding a slime a plort from another species, making them noticeably larger and able to produce multiple plorts. However, if a slime combines more than three traits by eating two different plorts, it becomes an aggressive malevolent black slime called "Tarr", which devours all other slimes around it. The player can pump fresh water from ponds and springs to splash and disintegrate the tarrs.<br /><br />

There are different kinds of slimes in the game, which all differ from small bits like simple ears and tails, to the ability to teleport or grab chicken via a vine that emerges from the ground. Docile and less harmful slimes include: Pink, Phosphor, Tabby, Quantum, Honey, Puddle, Hunter, Tangle, Dervish, Saber and Quicksilver Directly and indirectly harmful slimes are: Rock, Fire, Boom, Mosaic, Crystal, and Rad. And finally, the rarer or special types of slimes: Lucky and Gold.</p>
